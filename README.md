## Context

    One of the disciplines required in my undergraduate course at FATEC Sorocaba is Object-Oriented Programming (done in Java). I have decided to code the exercises assigned throughout the semester again and commit them to this repository. I think it's important to review what has been done, as it helps a lot in my learning of the language.

### Path

    I started completing generalization and specialization exercises, with and without polymorphism, then moved on to binary association, array lists, then finished by configuring and connecting my GUIs to the SQL Developer database.
